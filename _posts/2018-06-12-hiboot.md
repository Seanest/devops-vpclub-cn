# hiboot

hiboot is a cloud native web application framework written in Go.

hiboot is not trying to reinvent everything, it integrates [Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris), [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go), [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) [bolt](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt), [gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm), and more. all we have to do is make it simpler, easier to use.

With auto configuration, you can integrate any greate libraries easily with dependency injection support.

## Features

* Web MVC
* Auto Configuration, pre-create instance with properties configs for dependency injection
* Dependency injection with struct tag name inject:"" or Init method

## Getting started

### Get source code

```bash
go get -u github.com/hidevopsio/hiboot

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hidevopsio/hiboot/examples/web/helloworld/

```

#### Start coding

The simplest web application in Go.

```go
// Line 1: main package
package main

// Line 2: import web starter from hiboot
import "github.com/hidevopsio/hiboot/pkg/starter/web"

// Line 3-5: RESTful Controller, derived from web.Controller. The context mapping of this controller is '/' by default
type Controller struct {
	web.Controller
}

// Line 6-8: Get method, the context mapping of this method is '/' by default
// the Method name Get means that the http request method is GET
func (c *Controller) Get() string {
	// response data
	return "Hello world"
}

// Line 9-11: main function
func main() {
	// create new web application and run it
	web.NewApplication(&Controller{}).Run()
}

```

### Run

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Testing the API by curl

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

```bash
{
"code": 200,
"message": "Success",
"data": "hello hiboot"
}
```

Happy coding in go!
